# Reverse_complement_Genbank
**Kindly if you find this repo useful for your work, cite & star this repo**

This simple Python3 script aims to **Reverse and complement** genbank files (for genes, operons, or genomes).

## Usage

```bash
python3 reverse_genebank.py -i HTH_operon-2.gbk
```
As dependencies, you need to have Biopython, warning, and argparse (get them via pip3 or conda)

You will get your reversed file reversed as rev_{your_file}.gbk
